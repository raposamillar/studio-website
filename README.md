# Studio Website

I created and launched the current version of our studio website in **two days**, combining my skills in:

- Prompt engineering
- Coding
- Design thinking
- Content strategy

alongside an appetite for experimentation.

I used **Figma Make** to generate code through prompt engineering. By employing a cycle of continuous testing and feedback using **VS Code** and other online code editors, I quickly arrived at an **MVP**.

The website is hosted on **GitHub Pages** and uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
