                <h3>Our Teaching Philosophy</h3>
                
                <h4>Piano</h4>
                <p>
                    Playing the piano is one of life's great pleasures. We believe that anyone can be taught to play expressively. 
                    There are musical wonders to be enjoyed at every stage, from the simplest of tunes to the most intricate counterpoint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many paths are available for students studying piano. Some elect to prepare for festivals, exams, and university auditions, while others prefer to practice solely for personal growth and enjoyment. All students are encouraged to perform in our end-of-year Spring Recital.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Theory</h4>
                <p>
                    The study of music theory is an important complement to lessons, whether you sing, play the piano, violin, cello, or any other instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is music theory? Simply put it is the grammar and vocabulary of music. Knowledge of theory results in a deeper understanding and enjoyment of music. It is also a path to learning repertoire more quickly and securely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theory lessons closely follow the Royal Conservatory curriculum and examination requirements.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Skills for Life</h4>
                <p>
                    In both piano and theory, helping students develop technical and personal skills they can take beyond their years of lessons is our #1 priority.
                </p>

                            Children aged 10–12 are often in the late-beginning to early-intermediate stage with some still using method books and others tackling sonatinas. At this phase, we emphasize classical hand positioning with coordinated wrist and arm motions to bring music, such as that of J.S. Bach, to life. Special focus is given to triads, since playing multiple notes at once lets the piano truly feel like an orchestra at one's fingertips.

                            Teenagers continue to develop their musical tastes and, as their hands grow, they are able to access pieces requiring a span of an octave or more. In this intermediate stage, we focus on building solid habits while exploring the "foreign languages" of different composers. Early teens (13–15) learn to play four-note chords with a full sound, laying a foundation for studying Romantic repertoire by composers such as Frederic Chopin. Students in their mid- to late- teens (16–18), continue to refine their expressive range while studying music from the 17th to 21st centuries.
